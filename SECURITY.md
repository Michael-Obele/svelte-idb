## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within `svelte-idb`, please do not disclose it publicly!

Instead, please send an engaging email or private message via GitHub to the repository maintainer(s) directly. We will review all security reports and do our best to release a fix as soon as possible. 

You should expect an acknowledgment of your report within a reasonable timeframe (usually 48 hours).

In your report, please include:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce it (a minimal reproduction repo is highly appreciated).
- Any potential impact on users or systems.

Thank you for helping keep the open source ecosystem secure!
